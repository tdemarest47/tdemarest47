I have a long track record of building production-ready software.

I started my journey long ago as a C developer in DOS and UNIX environments, and contiunued on to this age of full-stack web development.
Along the way, my work has been eshipped inside printers (and their OS drivers), shrinkwrapped into boxed applications sold in software stores,
delivered to browsers over the internet, and run inside corporate data centers to maintain critical data pipelines.

My work has been mostly server-side, with a very strong database focus; but I am also comfortable working with client-side code and producing clean,
concise user interfaces.

## Projects for previous employers
  - Much of my work has been on internal software and sites, but there are a couple of public sites I can share

### Wheels Up: https://wheelsup.com/
  - I worked on the backend server behind this site, which was responsible for:
    - hydrating static content with live data from internal API.
    - serving page data to Web and Mobile (both iOS and Android) clients.
    - managing flight bookings, updates, status alerts etc. for end users.
    - technology stack was nodejs (typescript) atop a custom content delivery system and various internal API
   
### Electronics for Imaging: https://iq.fiery.com/
  - I worked on both server and client software for this project.
    - Primarily an IOT data capture application, connected to agents running on Fiery servers worldwide.
    - This grew to be a multi-application cloud, with a mixed licensing model to map applications / tenants / users / devices in various ways.
    - I was responsible for the core API and database schema to support this multi-app cloud.
    - I refined the client-side charting code to minimize user wait times / maximize code and data re-use.
    - I brought this project from a minimal POC to a production-ready platform.
    - technology stack was an angular frontend, and nodejs backend using MySQL, elasticsearch, redis, cassandra and rabbitmq for data management tasks.
